# Topic_summarization
This app summarizes topics based on Youtube videos and webpages through GPT-4. <br />  
![Topic App](example.png)

# Feature 
- Get a one-page topic summary from your input Youtube videos and webpages.

# Example
We are interested in the topic: "Twitter Founders on Muskâ€™s Tumultuous Takeover." <br />  
We found an interview video of Twitter founders: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKia5QUiGkE&t=16s <br />  
And a webpage that writes about it: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63402338 <br />  

The app combines that information, feeds it to GPT-4, and comes up with a summary. Save your time from listening to all those videos.
